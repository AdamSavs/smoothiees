# Prelude

NodeJS is a javascript runtime for non-browser environments.
It lets us run javascript like javaw lets you run Java code.

NPX is a tool that lets you run nodejs packages
NodeJS packages are referred to as NPM packages, as the website
you get them from and CLI is called https://www.npmjs.com
AKA Node Package Manager.

Tech we are using

- Typescript: A version of Javascript that has type annotations.
- React: This is a web development framework which lets you
 create your own web elements AKA components and have them rendered
 on the page.
- ChakraUI: A collection of pre-made components that you can use.

Created from this:

`npx create-react-app smoothiees --template @chakra-ui/typescript`
